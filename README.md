I was inspired to undertake this project after learning about wave optics and how it applies to image filtering
during my first semester of third year.  I wanted to apply my knowledge of python to a project I was passionate
about.

This project takes the Fourier Transfrom of an image in the form of a numpy array.  By applying a gaussian filter
to the frequency domain of the image I am able to apply a blurring effect.  This blurring effect is the result
of my filter eliminating the low frequency components of the image.

If you are new to the concept I have a simple explanation in my wiki.  This application of a Fourier Transform
is incredibly interesting and I would strongy recommend anyone interested in the idea to read up on it.
